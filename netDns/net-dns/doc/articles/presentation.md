# Presentation Format

The presentation format, sometimes called the `master file`,  is the textual representation of a 
[Resource Record](rr.md).  The Write and Read methods, 
defined in [IPresentationSerialiser](xref:Makaretu.Dns.IPresentationSerialiser), are used to serialize and 
deserialise a record.

The [PresentationWriter](xref:Makaretu.Dns.PresentationWriter) and 
[PresentationReader](xref:Makaretu.Dns.PresentationReader) classes are used to encode and decode data types.
